### Alice and Marks:

This program checks whether Alice is happy based on her score compared to Bob’s:

Input: It reads two integers, X (Alice’s score) and Y (Bob’s score).

Condition: It checks if Alice’s score X is at least twice Bob’s score Y (X >= 2 * Y).

Output:

If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", meaning Alice is happy.

Otherwise, it prints "No", meaning she isn’t happy.

The program uses a simple if-else to compare the scores and print the result accordingly. This matches the problem’s requirement to decide if Alice’s score is twice or more than Bob’s.
